        <dt id="community" class="anchor">What is a 'community'?</dt>
        <dd>'Communities' are groups that contribute content to LOAR. LOAR is set up to reflect the
          organization of a university where top level communities are universities (and the Danish Royal
          Library). Sub-communities may
          be departments, labs, research centers, schools, or other administrative units within an
          institution. The individual community has one or more community administrators who determine the
          community content guidelines and approve users as submitters in the community.
        </dd>
        <dt id="collection" class="anchor">What is a 'collection'?</dt>
        <dd>Communities in turn each have 'collections', which contain the content items (the data sets).</dd>
